# React In-depth: An exploration of UI development
At DevelopmentArc we have a long history with UI application development. We started back in the HTML 1.0 days, moved to Prototype.js and at the same time Flash. With the release of Flex, jumped in feet first and then dug deeper into AIR and device development. With the collapse of Flash/Flex we found ourselves back in HTML and JavaScript. 

Throughout the years we have continued to try and push the boundaries of UI technologies. Starting, in late 2014, we began initial research and then full adoption of React.js for our UI layer in our web applications.

The initial process of moving to React was a blend of excitement and at times, pure frustration. React brings in both existing UI paradigms and also new patterns that can take a bit of time to adjust your own mind-set to. Once we had fully grokked React, we found that it has opened the possibilities for our current and future projects.

Our goal with this GitBook is to document our process, share our research and try to organize our experiences into a single living document. Too be honest, this is a pretty lofty goal. We may not achieve this goal, but hopefully we can get some helpful thoughts down. 

We have found the longer your write code, the more you learn and then quickly forget. This means that our writings are just as much for ourselves as for others. With that in mind we hope that as this document grows it will help you, just as much as it helped us to put our own thoughts down.
