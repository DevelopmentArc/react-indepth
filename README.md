# React In-depth: An exploration of UI development
At [DevelopmentArc&reg;](http://developmentarc.com) we have a love affair with UI application development. We started appreciating  the complexity of UI interface development a long time ago with technologies like Authorware/Toolbook and Director. Quickly our founders moved to HTML 1.0 and to early JavaScript frameworks like  Prototype.js. As the industry progressed we began to focus our attention and business on the Flash Platform. With the release of the Flex framework, we jumped in feet first and then dug deeper into AIR and device development. With the collapse of Flash/Flex we found ourselves back in HTML and JavaScript.

Throughout the years we have continued to try and push the boundaries of UI technologies. Starting, in late 2014, we began initial research and then full adoption of [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for our UI layer in for web applications.

The initial process of moving to React was a blend of excitement and at times, pure frustration. React brings in both existing UI paradigms and also new patterns that can take a bit of time to adjust your own mind-set to. Once we had fully grokked React, we found that it has opened the possibilities for our current and future projects.

Our goal with this GitBook is to document our process, share our research and try to organize our experiences into a single living document. Too be honest, this is a pretty lofty goal. We may not achieve this goal, but hopefully we can get some helpful thoughts down. 

We have found the longer you write code, the more you learn and then shortly forget. This means that our writings are just as much for ourselves as for others. With that in mind we hope that as this document grows it will help you, just as much as it helped us to put our own thoughts down.
