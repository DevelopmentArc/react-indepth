# React Indepth: An exploration of UI development
At DevelopmentArc we have a long history with UI application development, from the inital HTML 1.0 days, Prototype.js, Flash, a deep commitment to Flex & AIR and then back to JavaScript. Through out the years we have continued to try and push the boundries of UI technologies. In late 2014, the DevelopmentArc team began inital research and then full adoption of React.js for our UI layer in our web applications.

The initial process of moving to React was a blend of excitement and at times, pure fustruation. React brings in both existing UI development paradaigms and also new patterns that can take a bit of time to adjust your own mind-set to. What we have found is pushing through these initial frustrations have opened the possiblities for our current and future projects.

Our goal with this GitBook is to document our process, share our research and try to orginaize our exeperiences into a single living document. Too be honest, this is a pretty lofty goal. We may not achive thi goal, but hopefully we can get some helpful thoughts down. 

We have found the longer your write code, the more you learn and then quickly forget. This means that our writings are just as much for ourselves as for others. So, with that in mind we hope that as this document grows it will help you, just as much as it helped us to put our own thoughts down.
