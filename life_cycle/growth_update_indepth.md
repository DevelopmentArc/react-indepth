# Growth/Update In-depth
 Once our Component is mounted in the Birth phase, we are prepped and ready for the Growth/Update phase. The Growth phase is where a component spends most of its time. Here we get data updates, act on user or system actions and provide the overall experience for our application.
 
 The Growth phase is triggered in three different ways: changing of `props`, changing `state` or `forceUpdate`.
