# The React Life Cycle
 Generally, most life forms go through a life cycle. The common path is birth, growth into maturity and then the inevitable death. UI applications follow a similar path. The application is first started, we consider this Birth into Growth. The users interacts with application, Growth into Maturity. Eventually, the application is closed or navigated away from, which is leads to Death.
 
 Within the application, elements also follow this pattern. In the world of React, these elements are our components. The component life cycle is a continuous process, which occurs throughout the overall life cycle of our application. Understanding this process can lead to faster development, easier optimization and overall application health.
