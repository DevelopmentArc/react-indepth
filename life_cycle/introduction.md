# The React Life Cycle
 One of the defining factors of a life form is its life cycle. The common path is birth, growth into maturity and then the inevitable death. UI applications often follow a similar path. When the application is first started, we consider this Birth. The users interacts with application, which is Growth into Maturity. Eventually, the application is closed or navigated away from, which is leads to Death.
 
 Within the application, elements also follow this pattern. In the world of React, these elements are our components. The component life cycle is a continuous process, which occurs throughout the overall life cycle of our application. Understanding this process can lead to faster development, easier optimization and overall application health.
