# The Life Cycle Recap
We have now worked through the three phases of the React life cycle: [Birth/Mounting](birth_mounting_indepth.md), [Growth/Update](growth_update_indepth.md) and finally [Death/Unmounting](death_unmounting_indepth.md). By having these phases and corresponding methods React provides us a clear path for developing Components. These phases also allow us to begin to optimize our Components and our entire application.
