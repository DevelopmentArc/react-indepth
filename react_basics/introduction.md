# [WIP] React From The Inside Out

***This section is currently being researched***

In the meantime, there are ton of getting started resources already available. If you are new to React we recommend spending some time looking at these fantastic resources:

* [React Official Site](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Awesome React](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) - A comprehensive list of resources
* [Learning React, Getting Started](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learning-react-getting-started-and-concepts) - Basic intro article

From a book development perspective, we have first focused on the React [Life Cycle chapters](../life_cycle/introduction.md) and [Component Evolution](../patterns/item_renderer_intro.md). We will circle back to this section soon.

## Guiding Principals to learning React
Unlike most intro books, we want to have different goals for our Basics Section. We will dig into the underpinnings of React and look at how to create applications from the bottom up. We feel that understanding the internals of a UI system helps drive development choices. We plan to explore React from this guiding principal.
